# EcoWaste - AI-Powered Waste Categorization Web App

EcoWaste is a web application designed to help users segregate their waste properly using AI-powered image recognition. The app encourages community engagement by offering rewards, leaderboards, and an integrated recycling pickup scheduling system. The app is built with React.js, TensorFlow.js for image recognition, and Firebase for authentication and data storage.

## üöÄ Features

- **AI-powered Waste Categorization**: Upload images of waste, and the app automatically categorizes them into the correct waste type (plastic, paper, organic, etc.).
- **Leaderboard System**: Earn points for recycling and compete on a community leaderboard.
- **Recycling Pickup Scheduling**: Users can schedule pickups with local waste management services directly through the app.
- **Rewards System**: Earn points that can be redeemed for eco-friendly products and contribute to sustainability.
- **Firebase Authentication**: Secure login and user data management using Firebase.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **Database**: Firebase Firestore
- **Authentication**: Firebase Authentication
- **AI for Image Recognition**: TensorFlow.js

## üí° How It Works

1. **Waste Categorization**:
   - Upload an image of your waste item.
   - The app uses TensorFlow.js to categorize the waste (e.g., plastic, paper, etc.).
   - Earn points for correctly segregating the waste.

2. **Leaderboard and Rewards**:
   - Accumulate points for sustainable waste practices.
   - Compete with others on the community leaderboard.
